                        JavaScript Array

In JavaScript, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
They are one of the most commonly used data structures for organizing and manipulating collections of data.
Arrays in JavaScript are flexible, allowing you to store elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.


# Key Features of JavaScript Arrays:-
1. Indexed Elements: Each element in an array has a numeric index, starting from 0.
2. Dynamic Size: Arrays in JavaScript can grow or shrink dynamically.
3. Mixed Data Types: You can store different types of values (numbers, strings, objects, etc.) in the same array.
4. Built-in Methods: JavaScript arrays come with various methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.


# Syntax for Creating Arrays:-

1. Using Array Literal (Recommended):
    let arrayName = [element1, element2, element3];

2. Using the Array Constructor:
    let arrayName = new Array(element1, element2, element3);

# Array Methods and Their Usage:
--------------------------------

1. Adding Elements:
    push() → Adds an element to the end of the array.
    unshift() → Adds an element to the beginning of the array.

2. Removing Elements:
    pop() → Removes the last element.
    shift() → Removes the first element.

3. Finding Elements:
    indexOf(value) → Finds the index of the first occurrence of a value.
    includes(value) → Checks if an element exists in the array.

4. Manipulating Elements:
    splice(startIndex, deleteCount, ...items) → Removes or replaces elements.
    slice(startIndex, endIndex) → Creates a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

5. Sorting:
    sort() → Sorts the array (default is lexicographical).
    reverse() → Reverses the array.

6. Transforming Arrays:
    map() → Creates a new array by transforming each element.
    filter() → Creates a new array with elements that pass a condition.

7. Iterating Over Arrays:
    Using a for loop
    Using forEach()
