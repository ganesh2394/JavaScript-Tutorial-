/**                 JavaScript JSON Objects
 * 
 * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for exchanging data between 
 * a server and a client or between different parts of an application. JSON is derived from 
 * JavaScript but is language-independent, meaning it can be used in many programming languages.
    In JavaScript, JSON objects are simply text formatted as key-value pairs, resembling 
    JavaScript objects. However, there are some important distinctions between JSON and JavaScript objects.
