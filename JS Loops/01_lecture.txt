                            JavaScript Loops

    Loops in JavaScript allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition. 
    They are a fundamental part of programming and help automate repetitive tasks.

   # Types of Loops in JavaScript
    1. for Loop
    2. while Loop
    3. do...while Loop
    4. for...in Loop
    5. for...of Loop


1. for Loop:-
The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations beforehand. It has three parts: 
    -> Initialization: Sets up a starting point.
    -> Condition: Checks if the loop should continue.
    -> Increment/Decrement: Updates the loop variable after each iteration.

Syntax : 

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute
}

2. while Loop:-
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. 
The loop runs as long as the condition is true.

Syntax : 

while (condition) {
  // Code to execute
}


3. do...while Loop:-
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once, 
regardless of the condition.

Syntax : 

do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);


4. for...in Loop:-
The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties (keys) of an object. 
It works with objects or arrays, but it is specifically designed for objects.

Syntax:

for (key in object) {
  // Code to execute
}

5. for...of Loop:-
The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or Map and Set.

Syntax:

for (variable of iterable) {
  // Code to execute
}
