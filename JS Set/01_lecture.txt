                            JavaScript Set

    A Set in JavaScript is a collection of unique values. It stores each value only once, 
    even if you attempt to add duplicates. Unlike arrays, Set automatically ensures that its 
    values are unique.

    # Features of Set:-
    1. Unique Values: Duplicate values are not allowed.
    2. Value Equality: Set uses the "SameValueZero" algorithm for value comparison, which is similar to strict equality (===).
    3. Data Types: Can store any data type, including primitives (strings, numbers, booleans) and object references.
    4. Order of Elements: A Set maintains the order of elements based on their insertion order.

    # Creating a Set:-
    You can create a Set using the new Set() constructor.
    syntax : 
    let mySet = new Set();


    # Methods of Set:-
    1. add(value): Adds a value to the Set.
    2. delete(value): Removes a value from the Set.
    3. has(value): Checks if the Set contains a specific value.
    4. clear(): Removes all elements from the Set.
    5. size: Returns the number of elements in the Set.

# Iterating Through a Set :- 
1. values(): Returns an iterator for the values.
2. keys(): Same as values() (provided for consistency with Map).
3. entries(): Returns an iterator for [value, value] pairs (for compatibility with Map).
4. forEach(callback): Executes a callback for each value in the Set.


# Use Cases of Set :-
1. Removing duplicates from an array.
2. Maintaining a collection of unique items (e.g., user IDs, email addresses).
3. Tracking unique events or actions in real-time applications.
